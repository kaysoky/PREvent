        <a href="https://code.google.com/p/tree-view-list-android/">tree-view-list-android</a> - This is a small widget that
        provides quite configurable tree view list. It is based on standard android list view. The widget is fully configurable -
        with your custom adapter you can provide your own implementation of the item views - even completely different
        implementation of item views depending on the tree level you are at. Implementation follows best approach of Adapters from
        android so views at the same tree level are reusable.
