title: Modified Project Proposal

### Background & Motivation
* Most (~50-60%) health problems originate from a person's local environment (home, office, etc)
  * See [Rishi Manchanda's TED talk](http://www.ted.com/talks/rishi_manchanda_what_makes_us_get_sick_look_upstream)
* Current health care system is generally ignores issues outside the hospital or clinic
* Many issues with the local environment are simple to identify, straight forward to address
* Many people are not aware of risk factors in the environment

### Concept
* Carry sensors for gaseous and airborne matter
* Couple sensor data with location data
* Relay data to via phone to cloud
* Alert user upon spikes in local risk factors
* Build maps of temporal and spatial risk factors around the user's location and paths
* Form factor: wrist or belt attachment

### Example Scenarios
* Ventilation filters to your office wear down and start spewing unfiltered air from outside
  * This problem is generally not noticeable until routine maintenance sees the filters
  * With the sensor suite, you would notice right away
* You adopt a furry pet.
  * With the sensor, you may notice a detrimental increase in dandruff and dust, prompting you to buy an air purifier
  * Without the sensor, you may feel shortness of breath and slight allergic responses a few months later
* TBC

### Competing Products
* Speck

  Home-based PM2.5 sensor
  
* SensorDrone

  Peripheral sensor expansion for phone

### Resources Needed
* Small particulate matter (PM10 & PM2.5) sensor
* Gas sensor
* Humidity sensor
