title: Lab Report 03
---
## This week (April 28-May 04):
* Our hardware arrived and we began assembling/building the device.
  * The PM sensor was disassembled and some excess plastic was cut off to save space.  See [before and after](https://github.com/kaysoky/PREvent/issues/10).
  * We will need to order dedicated battery charging circuitry, since the Arduino is not ideal for this task.  The [BOM](/PREvent/2015/04/14/Bill of Materials.html) was updated to match.
* The software backend was polished up and tentatively hosted on a [public IP](attu.cs.washington.edu:8000).
  * Data can be viewed and added to [this link](attu.cs.washington.edu:8000/data).
  * To support the heatmaps UI, some additional filters were added to the data API
    * /data/user -- Gets all data from the currently logged in user
    * xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax -- query string options for filtering over GPS coordinates
    * before, after -- query string options for filtering over time
  * We will rely on "security by obscurity" for concerns about spamming and privacy.
  * The front page contains the map UI, which is still in [development](https://github.com/kaysoky/PREvent/issues/7).
  * Some progress was made on the [Android companion app](https://github.com/kaysoky/PREvent/tree/android).  However, we still don't have a physical phone.
