## This week (April 07-13):
* We ironed out our project goals and description based on feedback from the previous week.
  See the [initial proposal](/PREvent/2015/04/08/Initial Project Proposal.html) and the [modified proposal](/PREvent/2015/04/12/Modified Project Proposal.html).
* We discussed and narrowed down the range of sensors to incorporate into our wearable.
  See the [sensor research](/PREvent/2015/04/12/More Sensor Research.html).
* We started to consider how best to divide the work and utilize our skillsets.
  See the [group member's skills](/PREvent/2015/04/10/Group Member Skills.html).
