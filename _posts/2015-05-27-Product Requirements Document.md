### Summary
Usually, we do not realize that more than 50% of health problems originate from  ambient air.  The air quality we should be concerned is not the same with what we check on weather forecasts but related to places more intimate in our lives such as our home and office.  However, our current air quality monitoring system can not provide such detailed and immediate data for each individual. That is why we choose to develop a wearable device that can continuously monitor the air quality around us.

### Deliverables
* Wearable wristband with LED indicators
* Web server backend to aggregate and analyze collected data as heap maps
* Android application as user interface

### Critical Features
* Accurately monitor environmental factors including humidity level, PM (particulate matter) density, VOC(volatile organic compound) density and temperature.
* Provide real time data and suggestions to users.
* Allow logging and analytics of collected data on server backend
* Comfortable and convenient to wear.
