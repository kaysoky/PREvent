### Summary
Usually, we do not realize that more than 50% of health problems originate from  ambient air.  The air quality we should be concerned is not the same with what we check on weather forecasts but related to places more intimate in our lives such as our home and office.  However, our current air quality monitoring system can not provide such detailed and immediate data for each individual. That is why we choose to develop a wearable device that can continuously monitor the air quality around us.

### Deliverables
* Wearable wristband with LED indicators
* Web server backend to aggregate and analyze collected data as heat maps
* Android application as user interface

### Critical Features
* Accurately monitor environmental factors including humidity level, PM (particulate matter) density, VOC(volatile organic compound) density and temperature.
* Provide real time data and suggestions to users.
* Allow logging and analytics of collected data on server backend
* Comfortable and convenient to wear.

### Milestones
See [project schedule](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=oml584uniamsa8ihe1kano3v18%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America/Los_Angeles)

### Team Member Responsibilities
* Jay Feng: web UI design, user experience
* William Hwang: Bluetooth integration, mechanical design, hardware design and integration
* Joseph Wu: Android development, Bluetooth integration, web server and UI construction
* Mingyu Zhang: Android development and UI design

### Materials & Budget
See [Bill of Materials](/PREvent/2015/04/14/Bill of Materials.html)

### Challenges
* Testing and calibrating the sensors such that their values are linked to regulatory standards from the EPA
* A small-ish form factor, given the typical size of particulate sensors
* Not to over-stress the apparent risks from air.  We live in a relatively low risk area
