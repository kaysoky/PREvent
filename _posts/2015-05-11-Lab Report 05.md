## This week (May 05-11):
* We wired up our TinyDuino to the VOC sensor and the Temperature/Humidity sensor. Arduino test code [here](https://github.com/kaysoky/PREvent/tree/arduino).
* Implemented sleep mode (with timer and push button wakeup) and Bluetooth communication. Both are functional.
* We ordered and received extra components for the PM sensor, as well as a battery charger circuit (microUSB).  This is the last sensor to breadboard/test.
* Battery, battery charger, and power consumption testing will commence once we verify that the data acquistion pipeline is functional (pending physical Android phone). Currently, we are using the USB port for serial output, which will intefere with the battery and power consumption tests. Once the data acquisition pipeline is functonal, we will be able to remoe the serial output from our code and test the power systems.
* Some progress was _probably_ made on the Android companion app, in a [separate repository](https://github.com/amberMZ/FirstApp).  TODO: Mingyu, upload your work.
* The original repository will build the Bluetooth component and then integrate itself with the other Android app.
  * Android Bluetooth example code for the BLE112 was taken from [here](https://www.bluegiga.com/en-US/products/ble112-bluetooth-smart-module/).  The example code is deprecated and does not build.  Instead, we used it as a reference.
  * Other references would be the [Android Bluetooth documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth.html) and the [Android Bluetooth LE documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth-le.html).
  * Android phone will be arriving on Tuesday.
* The TinyDuino's Bluetooth code was taken from [another example](https://github.com/jrowberg/bglib/tree/master/Arduino) and copied [here](https://github.com/kaysoky/PREvent/tree/arduino).
  * We confirmed that this code works with an iPhone6's Bluetooth (i.e. via a [free app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id557428110))
* Some progress was made on the Map UI.  The updated UI can be viewed [here](http://attu.cs.washington.edu:8000/)
  * The publicly available map UI does not have fake data (which we load into local instances for testing), so nothing should show up on that map.
  * We encountered glitches with the [heatmap.js](https://github.com/pa7/heatmap.js) code.
  * We switched to [Google's Heatmap Layer](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/heatmaplayer) instead.
  * Some buttons were added to toggle between temperature/humidity/VOC/particulates.
