## This week (May 05-11):
* We wired up our TinyDuino to the VOC sensor and the Temperature/Humidity sensor. Arduino test code [here (TODO: Upload this William)](https://github.com/kaysoky/PREvent/tree/arduino).
* We ordered and received extra components for the PM sensor, as well as a battery charger circuit (microUSB).  This is the last sensor to breadboard/test.
* Some progress was _probably_ made on the Android companion app, in a [separate repository](https://github.com/amberMZ/FirstApp).  TODO: Mingyu, upload your work.
* The original repository will build the Bluetooth component and then integrate itself with the other Android app.
  * Android Bluetooth example code for the BLE112 was taken from [here](https://www.bluegiga.com/en-US/products/ble112-bluetooth-smart-module/).  The example code is deprecated and does not build.  Instead, we used it as a reference.
  * Other references would be the [Android Bluetooth documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth.html) and the [Android Bluetooth LE documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth-le.html).
  * TODO: Jay, what's the progress on that Android phone?
* The TinyDuino's Bluetooth code was taken from [another example](https://github.com/jrowberg/bglib/tree/master/Arduino) and copied [here](https://github.com/kaysoky/PREvent/tree/arduino).
  * We confirmed that this code works with an iPhone6's Bluetooth (i.e. via a [free app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id557428110))
* Some progress was made on the Map UI.  The updated UI can be viewed [here](http://attu.cs.washington.edu:8000/)
  * The publicly available map UI does not have fake data (which we load into local instances for testing), so nothing should show up on that map.
  * We encountered glitches with the [heatmap.js](https://github.com/pa7/heatmap.js) code.
  * We switched to [Google's Heatmap Layer](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/heatmaplayer) instead.
  * Some buttons were added to toggle between temperature/humidity/VOC/particulates.
